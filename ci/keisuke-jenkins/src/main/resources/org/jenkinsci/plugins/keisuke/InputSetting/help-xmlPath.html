<div>
If you want to use customized language definitions for keiseuke.count, 
specify the file path of a XML file which contains language definitions. <br>
The base directory to specify a relative path is <a href="ws">workspace</a>. (e.g. 'config/language.xml')<br>
If the file is not under workspace, you should write an absolute path. (e.g. '/home/develop/conf/language.xml')
